<h1>Build a hierarchy</h1>

I access the application as _standard user_.

There is a sidebar to the left of the screen. The hierarchy is displayed in the right part.

⚙️ A goal element is automatically added with a placeholder indicating "*Goal's title*".

👤 I specify the goal of the process

- I give the goal's name

⚙️ Two major criteria are created. They are named "*Criterion A*" and "*Criterion B*"

👤 I edit the name of the two criteria

👤 I add a criterion to the goal or a sub-criterion to an existing criterion

- I add a new criterion associated to an existing element (the goal or a criterion)
- I give a name to the new criterion

If the number of sub-criteria associated to a criterion is 0 then the criterion is **_final_**: this is a leave of the
hierarchy tree.

👤 I add alternatives

- I add an alternative
- I give a name to the alternative
